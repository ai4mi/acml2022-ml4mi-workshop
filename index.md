<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Data-driven methods have shown remarkable success in many medical imaging tasks over the past decade. With the rapid advancement of technology, novel applications and methods are on the rise. In this workshop we invite high quality papers from researchers who are exploring novel Machine Learning methods pertaining to medical image analysis tasks. While we invite papers on general medical image analysis we lay greater emphasis on recent ML techniques including but not limited to Ethical AI, Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging, Interpretability in Medical AI, Temporal Learning Strategies in Medical Vision, and Low data/ Resource Efficient Medical Image Analysis.
</p>

<h3>Topics of interest</h3>

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Data efficiency
* Transfer learning
